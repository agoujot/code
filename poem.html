		<textarea id="textin" rows="40" cols="20" style="resize:none" placeholder="put text here, click outside, and input will be poemised to clipboard. settings can be specified with by putting =[a letter] [the value] on its own line. an indent pattern, given with =r, or the last input's pattern will be used. it is made of numbers (indicating the number of :'s before that line), _'s (inserts a stanza break), a number (of times to be repeated) * a pattern, a grouped expression with (), or two patterns with +. the pattern will be converted only to numbers and _'s. For example, =r 2*01+_ is converted to 0101_. this result is applied cyclically, meaning that the 1st line will be indented 0, the 2nd 1, ..., the fifth will have a stanza break before, and then it is indented 0 (looping back). if a pattern is interrupted by a page break, you can tell this to start the pattern at a specific index with =i."></textarea>
