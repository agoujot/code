Various stuff over here:

Good & ready to use:
- `build.ml` is what I use to compile my ocaml code, look for dependencies, etc
- `cat.ml` is a module to run cellular automata (Cellular Automata Terminal), and `use.ml` is an example use of it, with CAs I like and/or made
- `chess.ml` is chess and a bot for it (the bot's work-in-progress)
- `go.ml` is the game of go
- `sierpinski-code.py` and `sierpinski.ml` draw sierpinski triangles
- `sorts.ml` is a demonstration of sorting algorithms

Other stuff, often superseded, in /old:
- `echecc.py` is a python, much less advanced, version of `chess.ml`, without bot or actual graphic display
- `goc.py` is a python, much less advanced, version of `go.ml`
- `go_old.ml` is an earlier version of `cat.ml`. it had automatic pattern coloring, but that made it very slow and required large sets of patterns, so I dropped it
- `simulateur.html`, `simulateur.js`, and the accompanying `styles.css` are a middle step between an earlier version of cat.ml and the latest one
- `whatever.ml` and `whatever_2d.ml` are a tentative at making ... something? There's potential, though, should look at it closer.
- `-_-.py` is a test I did for semi-eulerian paths, terrible algorithm, to redo better one of these days
- `dungeonbuilder.ml` and `dungeonshower.ml` (ocaml version), `dm.html`, `dp.html`, and `dm.js` (JS version) are a tentative at making a system for creating maps for RPGs
- `mobs.html` and `mobs.js` are a tentative at making a simple system for tracking encounters in RPGs
